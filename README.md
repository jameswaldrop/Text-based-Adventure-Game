This is my first Python program for a text-based adventure game called "Space Quest".  The program imports necessary modules, initializes variables, and defines several functions to run the game.

The game begins with a greeting function that determines the time of day and prints a corresponding message. Then, an intro function sets the scene for the game and prompts the player to choose between fighting the aliens or crashing the ship.

The command_center function is called to handle the player's choice, and the game ends with a game_restart function that asks the player if they want to play again.

To run the game, call the main function space_quest().
